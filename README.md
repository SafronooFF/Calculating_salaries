# Calculating_salaries
  I needed a program that would help me: calculate my salary, show how much I earned and on which day, and also help me understand when salary payments occurred and in what amount.
*More details about the problem:*
  I can only come to work when I have time before my studies, and I receive a fixed salary for each day worked. At the end of the month, I inform my boss how much he owes me and receive the payment. However, he can also pay me part of the amount earlier upon my request.
  Instead of keeping everything on paper and manually filling out text in Excel, I decided to write a simple program that would make my life much easier.

P.S. Since I'm from Russia, all comments in the program are in Russian. The buttons are also labeled in Russian.
